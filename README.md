# visual.tools

Visual Tools is a live, collaborative framework for developing full stack, embedable visualisations. Our space combines technologies to create a pipeline from data acquisition through to presentation.

The focus of visual tools is not so much on data acquisition and homogonisation, but on presentation. We seek to enable individuals and businesses to create effective, impactful visualisations of systems of equations, or linked data, or any other source of valuable knowledge.

A working demo can be found here: https://production.freefreecrowdfunding.org

If you have any questions about usage or developing more tools into the pipeline, please drop us a line. Documentation will follow... by maybe Spring 2017
